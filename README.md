# Internship_CVUT_2025
Internship in Prague for detection of neighbouring relations between mobile network base stations. Added this year : road detection.


## Database

You will find the database here https://data.arcep.fr/mobile/sites/ 
Please rename it '''data.csv''' and put it in a directory named __database__.
We also use another database for one notebook, about azimuth. It is found here : https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/donnees-sur-les-installations-radioelectriques-de-plus-de-5-watts-1/. Download the zip and keep only the file named "SUP_ANTENNE", and rename it '''data_azimuth_freq'''. You will also need to change the name of some columns : STA_NM_ANFR -> id_station_anfr ; AER_NB_AZIMUT -> angle_azimuth

## Documentation

You will also find the slides we used for the weekly presentations, as well as the writen final report.
